<h1><i>Vadhiv(adj)</i>:</h1> 

#### A suitable english word would be a whimsical person or an act. Initially it was used to describe a person, by saying stuff such as Kay vadhiv ahe to. But soon enough its other forms started appearing. Vadhivpana, vadhivgiri etc.

##### Example: Arre Rohit kasla vadhiv vagato
